            // These allow you to upload a bunch of data to a buffer, and send the buffer to the graphics card.
            // This effectively sends all the vertices at the same time.

            // The first argument is an enum, specifying what type of buffer we're binding. A VBO is an ArrayBuffer.
            // There are multiple types of buffers, but for now, only the VBO is necessary.

            //   Which buffer the data should be sent to.
            //   How much data is being sent, in bytes. You can generally set this to the length of your array, multiplied by sizeof(array type).
            //   The vertices themselves.
            //   How the buffer will be used, so that OpenGL can write the data to the proper memory space on the GPU.
            //   There are three different BufferUsageHints for drawing:
            //     StaticDraw: This buffer will rarely, if ever, update after being initially uploaded.
            //     DynamicDraw: This buffer will change frequently after being initially uploaded.
            //     StreamDraw: This buffer will change on every frame.
            //   Writing to the proper memory space is important! Generally, you'll only want StaticDraw,
            //   but be sure to use the right one for your use case.
            GL.BufferData(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, _vertices.Length * sizeof(float), _vertices, BufferUsageHint.StaticDraw);

            // We've got the vertices done, but how exactly should this be converted to pixels for the final image?
            // Modern OpenGL makes this pipeline very free, giving us a lot of freedom on how vertices are turned to pixels.
            // The drawback is that we actually need two more programs for this! These are called "shaders".
            // Shaders are tiny programs that live on the GPU. OpenGL uses them to handle the vertex-to-pixel pipeline.
            // Check out the Shader class in Common to see how we create our shaders, as well as a more in-depth explanation of how shaders work.
            // shader.vert and shader.frag contain the actual shader code.
            _shader = new Shader("plain.shader.vert", "plain.shader.frag");

            // Now, enable the shader.
            // Just like the VBO, this is global, so every function that uses a shader will modify this one until a new one is bound instead.

            // Now, we need to setup how the vertex shader will interpret the VBO data; you can send almost any C datatype (and a few non-C ones too) to it.
            // While this makes them incredibly flexible, it means we have to specify how that data will be mapped to the shader's input variables.

            // To do this, we use the GL.VertexAttribPointer function
            // Arguments:
            //   Location of the input variable in the shader. the layout(location = 0) line in the vertex shader explicitly sets it to 0.
            //   How many elements will be sent to the variable. In this case, 3 floats for every vertex.
            //   The data type of the elements set, in this case float.
            //   Whether or not the data should be converted to normalized device coordinates. In this case, false, because that's already done.
            //   The stride; this is how many bytes are between the last element of one vertex and the first element of the next. 3 * sizeof(float) in this case.
            //   The offset; this is how many bytes it should skip to find the first element of the first vertex. 0 as of right now.
            // Stride and Offset are just sort of glossed over for now, but when we get into texture coordinates they'll be shown in better detail.

            // For a simple project, this would probably be enough. However, if you have a bunch of objects with their own shaders being drawn, it would be incredibly
            // tedious to do this over and over again every time you need to switch what object is being drawn. Because of this, OpenGL now *requires* that you create
            // what is known as a Vertex Array Object (VAO). This stores the layout you create with VertexAttribPointer/EnableVertexAttribArray so that it can be
            // recreated with one simple function call.
            // By creating the VertexArrayObject above, it has automatically saved this layout, so you can simply bind the VAO again to get everything back how it should be.

            // Finally, we bind the VBO again so that the VAO will bind that as well.
            // This means that, when you bind the VAO, it will automatically bind the VBO as well.
